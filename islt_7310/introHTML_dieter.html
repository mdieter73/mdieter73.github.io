     My name is Matt Dieter and I am from New Wilmington, Pennsylvania, which is about an hour north of Pittsburgh.  My wife, a high school math teacher, and I have two children - a seventeen-year-old son and a fourteen-year-old daughter.  I am an elementary school principal and adjunct professor of education at Thiel College in Greenville, Pennsylvania.   I have some experience creating web pages using programs like Weebly, Wix and Google Sites, but have not developed a page using HTML and CSS.  In this course, I am hoping to gain the knowledge to be able to build and maintain a website from the coding level and on up.  I am working on my degree in online education so my desire would be to gain the ability to design eLearning materials using the web development skills I have acquired during this course.  My favorite hobby is watching sports which has become impossible over the past few weeks!
