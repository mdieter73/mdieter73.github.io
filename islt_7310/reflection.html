<h3>Career Goals</h3>
    
<div id="columns">
    <p id="para1">My professional career has taken me from a classroom teacher to a building principal to an adjunct undergraduate college faculty member.  I have taught students from rural areas and suburban communities, students from low income homes and students from the upper-middle class.  I have worked with elementary, middle school, college students and classroom teachers.  Each of these experiences has helped to mold me into the educator I am today.
    
    <p class="indented">During each of my experiences I always felt a desire to make an impact on the environment in which I was working and help the people around me to improve.  As a classroom teacher, I often sought opportunities to lead building committees and to work with my colleagues on ways to improve the school.  As a school administrator, I was able to further expand my level of influence by leading building-wide initiatives.  Even though I wasn’t directly working with students I was able increase the level of education they were receiving by improving the skills of my teachers.  Upon becoming an undergraduate adjunct professor of education, I was able to help prepare the next generation of teachers in creating and delivering effective instruction for tomorrow’s students.
      
    <p class="indented">As an educator, my focus has been to create the most productive learning environment possible for my students and my colleagues.  A common thread present during each of my teaching experiences was an interest in exploring ways to develop and infuse technology tools and resources into the classroom to enhance the learning process.  Tools and resources that cause teachers to re-imagine the design of their lessons and make teaching strategies more effective and assist students in grasping new concepts with greater ease.  Resources that enable students and teachers to communicate, collaborate, engage in critical thinking and encourage creativity in the classroom. Inspired by my experiences in working college students, I also have a growing interest in online education and how best to develop activities and assessments for effective learning experiences.
   
    <p class="indented">With those interests and goals in mind, I am interested in acquiring a position in higher education in the field of instructional design/technology or as an online educator.  Receiving a position in higher education would provide an opportunity to make an impact on the lives of the students I would instruct and faculty members with which I would collaborate, who in turn would make a difference in the lives of each of the students they would serve.</p>
